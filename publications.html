<li> <a>A Non-Inclusive Memory Permissions Architecture for Protection Against Cross-Layer Attacks</a> (HPCA'14) <br\>

<h6 style="font-weight:200">Protecting modern computer systems and complex software
stacks against the growing range of possible attacks is becoming
increasingly difficult. The architecture of modern
commodity systems allows attackers to subvert privileged system
software often using a single exploit. Once the system
is compromised, inclusive permissions used by current architectures
and operating systems easily allow a compromised
high-privileged software layer to perform arbitrary malicious
activities, even on behalf of other software layers.
This paper presents a hardware-supported page permission
scheme for the physical pages that is based on the concept of
non-inclusive sets of memory permissions for different layers
of system software such as hypervisors, operating systems,
and user-level applications. Instead of viewing privilege levels
as an ordered hierarchy with each successive level being
more privileged, we view them as distinct levels each with its
own set of permissions. Such a permission mechanism, implemented
as part of a processor architecture, provides a common
framework for defending against a range of recent attacks. We
demonstrate that such a protection can be achieved with negligible
performance overhead, low hardware complexity and
minimal changes to the commodity OS and hypervisor code</h6>

 <li> <a>Iso-X: A Flexible Architecture for Hardware-Managed Isolated Execution</a> (MICRO'14) <br>

<h6 style="font-weight:200">We consider the problem of how to provide an
execution environment where the application’s secrets are safe
even in the presence of malicious system software layers. We
propose Iso-X — a flexible, fine-grained hardware-supported
framework that provides isolation for security-critical pieces
of an application such that they can execute securely even in
the presence of untrusted system software. Isolation in Iso-X is
achieved by creating and dynamically managing compartments
to host critical fragments of code and associated data. IsoX
provides fine-grained isolation at the memory-page level,
flexible allocation of memory, and a low-complexity, hardwareonly
trusted computing base. Iso-X requires minimal additional
hardware, a small number of new ISA instructions to manage
compartments, and minimal changes to the operating system
which need not be in the trusted computing base. The run-time
performance overhead of Iso-X is negligible and even the overhead
of creating and destroying compartments is modest. IsoX
offers higher memory flexibility than the recently proposed
SGX design from Intel, allowing both fluid partitioning of the
available memory space and dynamic growth of compartments.
An FPGA implementation of Iso-X runtime mechanisms shows
a negligible impact on the processor cycle time.
